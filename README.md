Momobot2 is the successor of [momobot](https://github.com/bjm021/momobot)
<br>Rewritten completely to use the new Discord Bot API.

## Goal
The goal of this Project is to have a simple, modified, up-to-date music bot that uses the new API to fit the requirements of servers run by me. Don't expect to much  from this bot, it's just a simple bot for a few servers.

## Features
As this is a complete rewrite of the original bot, some features are still missing but will be implemented with priority.<br>
As stated this is a simple bot and should be no more. Expect standard music bot functionality.

- Standard music bot functionality
- Manipulate EQ on the fly (planned)
- Load and Save queues (at least up to 8 latest entries) (planned)
- more in the future  

## Getting Started
> will be added soon
